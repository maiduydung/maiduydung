## 👋 Hi, I'm Mai

**Trilingual Data & ML Engineer** (English / Vietnamese / Japanese)

I build end-to-end data and AI systems for fast-moving startups and SaaS companies. Proven track record across Tokyo, Shanghai, Vancouver, NYC, and SF.

### What I Do

I combine technical depth with a founder's mindset to deliver results, not just code. From infrastructure to insights, I handle:

- ☁️ **Cloud-Native Data Infrastructure** - Scalable Azure-based pipelines that are clean, tested, and production-ready
- 🔍 **Web Scraping at Scale** - Zillow-level data extraction with automation that stays fresh and compliant
- 📊 **Real-Time & Batch Analytics** - Lightweight reporting stacks and internal tools for data-driven decisions
- 🤖 **Applied ML & AI** - Chatbots, search, and classification models that actually work—no AI theater, just real value
- 💼 **VC Tools & Real Estate Intelligence** - Full-stack platforms for investor workflows, deal sourcing, and property ROI analysis

### Why Work With Me

- **Founder Mindset, Builder Execution** - I code like a builder and think like a founder, understanding business context behind technical requirements
- **Led Data Infra at a SaaS Startup** - Hands-on experience building and leading data infrastructure in fast-paced, high-growth environments
- **Async & Cross-Timezone Native** - Experienced with distributed teams—no hand-holding required, I deliver results independently
- **Fast, Reliable & Battle-Tested** - My solutions are production-tested and built to be reliable and performant

### Tech Stack

**Backend:** FastAPI, Azure Functions, Container Apps, Service Bus, Logic Apps
